## Race Game :zap:
did you notice the back cover is actually a board game? 🧐

yep you heard it right, and it's a straightforward yet fun game with all your favorite LPC elements 🤪

### Setup & Game Play 
Here's how you can play it:

1. Download the [printable die and game pieces](https://github.com/yearbook22-lpc/yearbook22-lpc.github.io/blob/5aca1895571193b1cfe5eb255fe7c4850fe04204/Printable.png); cut them out and tape the sides together

2. Each player chooses a playing piece and places it on :pin: tile 1 (the LPC gate for obvious reason) 

3. Find instructions 
    - instructions here
    - or click here for the still image (but clearly the animation is a lot cooler)


4. Start the game :hourglass:
